#ContentDM api wrapper library

this repository is a work in progress. Actually, I've only gotten collections working so far.  It's based on [simple-CONTENTdm](https://github.com/archives-of-michigan/simple-CONTENTdm) from archives of michigan.  I never finished it, but it might be a good start for someone else looking to do this kind of work.

the goal was to improve the cdm ui using the api. I've only got listing fields in collections.  This readme was written several months after the work so I don't remember much.

Collections are implemented.
